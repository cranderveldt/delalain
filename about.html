      <p>Emmanuel Delalain<br>Atelier Delalain</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Delalain's education in the craft of furniture began in his family's atelier in the South of France. There, in a small village on the Mediterranean coast, he worked from early childhood helping his father and grandfather build sailboatsâ€”and helping his mother, a chef, in the kitchen. His inspired ingenuity showed early: As payment for his labor, young Emmanuel was allowed to use the tools and wood scraps from the shop to build a plane for fear he might actually succeed.</p>
      <p>When he first arrived in the United States, Emmanuel built sets for commercials, music videos and fashion shows. In the early 1990's, working in his East Village apartment, he began building furniture for friends. He opened his own shop in Brooklyn in 1998, and recently expanded the current shop, located on Jay Street in Dumbo. He became a United States citizen in 2004 and now considers the U.S. his permanent home.</p>
      <p>Today, the rigors of Emmanuel's early training are evident in the signature appeal of his furniture. His passion for materials reveals itself in a startling sensuality of surface; his respect for the beauty of functional design creates a harmonious simplicity of line. Committed to quality in the execution even of hidden details, Atelier Delalain creates innovative contemporary furniture informed by classical tradition, integrating base elements of wood and metal with materials including glass, stone, and concrete. All furniture is made to order and customized to meet clients' needs.</p>
